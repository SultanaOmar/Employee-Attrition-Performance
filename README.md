For this project, I was interested in using the data set so I could come up with a prediction and data analysis model to try to answer the following questions:
*  Is it only the salary that attracts the employee in the work environment?
*  Is it possible to have motivating factors for an employee to stay in the organization?
*  Is it possible that the director of the organization is not cooperative and understanding that the organization will lose employees?
